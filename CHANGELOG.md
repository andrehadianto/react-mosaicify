### v0.3.0

* `minTileWidth` and `noRoundedCorners`. Read the API docs for more information!

* 🛑 **Breaking Change**: The `noOfColumns` prop has been removed and replaced with `minTileWidth`. This change allows for a more responsive grid layout. Instead of a fixed number of columns, the grid will now fit to its container's width, with each column having a minimum width defined by `minTileWidth`.
